### About me

ðŸŒ± I am young, fresh, and motivated;

ðŸ¤” I have an analytical mindset and attention to detail;

ðŸ”­ I consider self-education my hobby, as I feel unproductive when not learning something new every day;

ðŸ’… I am passionate about everything related to design â€” beautiful websites, profiles, clothing, and the world around us. That's why I aspire to become a web developer;

ðŸ‘¯ I want to be a part of the creativity that addresses numerous daily challenges, paying attention to every detail.
